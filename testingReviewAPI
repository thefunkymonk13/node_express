1.) First get an existing ID

2.) Make a post request to http://localhost:3033/api/v1/movies/review

3.) Provide a review body like:

{
	"movie_id": "573a1394f29313caabcdfa38",
	"review": "great movie",
	"user_id": "1234",
	"name": "john"
}

4.) Click send and you should get a status: success response

5.) Go to mongodb and look for your new post. You need to refresh if it is a new collection.

6.) Next we will try to test the edit function. We will need the review_id of an existing review.

7.) We will now send a PUT request with a JSON object like:

{
"review_id": "63438f3db02f7e4447aa5e84",
"review": "bad movie",
"user_id": "1234",
"name": "john"
}

8.) Go to mongodb and check that it was edited

9.) Next we will check the delete review endpoint. Send a delete request to your localhost like:

{
  "review_id": "63438f3db02f7e4447aa5e84",
  "user_id": "1234"
}

10.) Go to mongodb and select refresh to verify the post no longer exists

NEXT WE WILL CREATE A ROUTE TO GET A SINGLE ITEM AND ITS VALUES
