1.) Go to your route in your browser to make sure you can see the data. Our example is:

http://localhost:3033/api/v1/movies

2.) Download Insomnia to test API's

3.) Make a GET request to your API. Our example again is:

http://localhost:3033/api/v1/movies

NEXT WE WILL TEST THE FILTERS

4.) To apply filters we add them to the URL query string for example:

http://localhost:3033/api/v1/movies?rated=G

5.) To filter for page 2:

http://localhost:3033/api/v1/movies?rated=G&page=2

6.) To search by title you need to set up the title index in MongoDB. Go to your database, collection and then select Indexes

7.) Select create index and under fields enter

{
  "title": "text",
}

8.) Select confirm and it will create our index to support text search queries on string content. You can test it by sending a request to:

http://localhost:3033/api/v1/movies?title=Seven

NEXT WE WILL ADD THE ROUTES FOR POST, PUT, AND DELETE
